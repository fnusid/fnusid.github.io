I am thrilled to share one of the projects I had the privilege of working on during my time at BrainChip - aTENNuate has been accepted at Interspeech 2025. This highly performant model represents a breakthrough in real-time speech enhancement, working directly on raw waveforms with lightning-fast speed.
