## About Me

I am a second year master's student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Washington, Seattle. I reveived my bachelor's in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering from College of Engineering Trivandrum.

My research interests broadly lie in speech and language processing, computational neuroscience, and machine learning.

In University of Washington, I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Jeffrey Herron](https://sites.uw.edu/jeffherr/) and [Dr. Rajesh Rao](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/rao) in [Neural Systems lab](https://neural.cs.washington.edu) where I work alongside [Vishwas Sathish](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ad01nlUAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Samantha Sun](https://samantha-sun.com) on identifying potential biomarker for pain from electrophysiological signals. 

I am also a part of [Mobile Intelligence lab](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~gshyam/) where I work on developing a volume controlled target speech extraction in noisy environments alongside [Tuochao Chen](https://staff.washington.edu/tuochao/), [Malek Itani](https://malekitani.github.io) and [Dr. Shyam Gollakota](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~gshyam/). 

Prior to joining University of Washington, I was a research intern at the [Learning and Extraction of Acoustic Patterns (LEAP) lab](http://leap.ee.iisc.ac.in) where I worked alongside [Dr. Sriram Ganapathy](http://www.leap.ee.iisc.ac.in/sriram/) on the [DISPLACE 2023 Challenge](https://displace2023.github.io).
