      Responsibilities include:
        - Pioneered a dual-microphone enhancement framework integrating internal and external ear microphone signals to improve intelligibility and mitigate speech drop in low-SNR conditions.
        - Designed a low-parameter, streamable U-Net-based architecture with a cross-attention mechanism to fuse two-channel feature representations for real-time deployment.
        - Collected and curated a real-world evaluation dataset using a dummy-head HAT recording system for robust, ecologically valid testing.
        - Introduced SpeechDROPBERT, a novel SpeechBERT-based evaluation metric for quantifying speech-drop effects.
        - Achieved DNSMOS OVRL 2.40 on the curated test set vs. 2.25 in a beamformer + speech enhancement baseline, and SpeechDROPBERT 0.88 vs. 0.60 baseline, demonstrating substantial perceptual and robustness gains

## About Me

I am a first year PhD student at the [Soundability Lab](https://accessibility.eecs.umich.edu/) at University of Michigan CSE dept. advised by [Dr. Dhruv Jain](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~profdj/), where I focus on developing deep learning algorithms for hearables. Prior to joining UMich, I graduated with an MS in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Washington, Seattle.

My research interests broadly lie in speech, audio and language processing and deep learning.

In University of Washington, I was fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Jeffrey Herron](https://sites.uw.edu/jeffherr/) and [Dr. Rajesh Rao](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/rao) in [Neural Systems lab](https://neural.cs.washington.edu) where I work alongside [Vishwas Sathish](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ad01nlUAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Samantha Sun](https://samantha-sun.com) on identifying potential biomarker for pain from electrophysiological signals. 

I was also a part of [Mobile Intelligence lab](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~gshyam/) where I worked on developing a volume controlled target speech extraction in noisy environments alongside [Tuochao Chen](https://staff.washington.edu/tuochao/), [Malek Itani](https://malekitani.github.io) and [Dr. Shyam Gollakota](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~gshyam/). 

Prior to joining University of Washington, I was a research intern at the [Learning and Extraction of Acoustic Patterns (LEAP) lab](http://leap.ee.iisc.ac.in) where I worked alongside [Dr. Sriram Ganapathy](http://www.leap.ee.iisc.ac.in/sriram/) on the [DISPLACE 2023 Challenge](https://displace2023.github.io).
