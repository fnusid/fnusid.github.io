abstract: In multilingual societies, social conversations often involve
          code-mixed speech. The current speech technology may not be
          well equipped to extract information from multi-lingual multi-
          speaker conversations. The DISPLACE challenge entails a first-
          of-kind task to benchmark speaker and language diarization on
          the same data, as the data contains multi-speaker conversations
          in multilingual code-mixed speech. The challenge attempts to
          highlight outstanding issues in speaker diarization (SD) in mul-
          tilingual settings with code-mixing. Further, language diariza-
          tion (LD) in multi-speaker settings also introduces new chal-
          lenges, where the system has to disambiguate speaker switches
          with code switches. For this challenge, a natural multilingual,
          multi-speaker conversational dataset is distributed for develop-
          ment and evaluation purposes. The systems are evaluated on
          single-channel far-field recordings. We also release a baseline
          system and report the highlights of the system submissions.
